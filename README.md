Let’s be honest — the job market today is broken. You can send out hundreds, even thousands, of applications, and what? Maybe get a handful of replies—if you’re lucky. From those, you might land a few interviews, move forward in one or two, and hopefully end up with a single offer.

Between tough classes, studying, work, and trying to have some sort of social life, your day already feels too short. And then you’re supposed to find time to apply for jobs? They say job hunting is a full-time job—and honestly, it’s more than that.

If you are a student, that grind hits even harder. Between tough classes, studying, work, and trying to have some sort of social life, your day already feels too short, and 24 hours is definetely not enough.

I will not even mention if you are a student-athlete... Team practices, individual practices, team lifts, meetings, matches, travels, PT in case of an injury. How can you fit it all in a 24h day?

And plus this, you’re supposed to find time to apply for jobs? They say job hunting is a full-time job — and honestly, it’s way more than that.

Applications. Networking. Cover letters. Interviews.
It’s a lot of work, right? I am kinda of a lazy person and I wouldnt like to do this by myself.

What if you have someone that could do all that and much more for you? Actually, not someone. What.

That’s where ANGELa comes in.

ANGELa comes to change the way you look for internships and jobs.
